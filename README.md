I will be keeping the overhead simple. This is a place where I will do my best to record what I do to improve my knowledge, skills, and abilities in the realm of cybersecurity. And likely some rants as well. Nobody will be looking at this and so it's a safe space... 

Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are the cornerstones of Cybersecurity. Unfortunately, every certification, every organziation, and every ego-maniacle gate-keepr in the industry thinks their definition is the aboslute pinnacle. They think this for some reason that is as yet completely mystical to me.  

The reality is that good definitions rarely give answers. Instead, these definitions should prompt questions on the part of the professional. In 1991, John McCumber, in his book "Assessing and managing security risk in IT systems : a structured methodology" gave us the most effective and useful definitions for the pillars.
