# Zeek

- (formerly Bro) is an open-source and commercial network monitoring tool (traffic analyser).

- The official description;

- "Zeek (formerly Bro) is the world's leading platform for network security monitoring. Flexible, open-source, and powered by defenders."

- "Zeek is a passive, open-source network traffic analyser.

- Many operators use Zeek as a network security monitor (NSM) to support suspicious or malicious activity investigations.

- Zeek also supports a wide range of traffic analysis tasks beyond the security domain, including performance measurement and troubleshooting."

## Introduction to Network Monitoring Approaches

- Network monitoring is a set of management actions to watch/continuously overview and optionally save the network traffic for further investigation.

- This action aims to detect and reduce network problems, improve performance, and in some cases, increase overall productivity.

- It is a main part of the daily IT/SOC operations and differs from Network Security Monitoring (NSM) in its purpose.

### Network Monitoring

- Network monitoring is highly focused on IT images like uptime (availability), device health and connection quality (performance), and network traffic balance and management (configuration).

- Monitoring and visualizing the network traffic, troubleshooting, and root cause analysis are also part of the Network Monitoring process.

- This model is helpful for network administrators and usually doesn't cover identifying non-asset in-depth vulnerabilities and significant security concerns like internal threats and zero-day vulnerabilities.

- Usually, Network Monitoring is not within the SOC scope.

- It is linked to the enterprise IT/Network management team.

### Network Security Monitoring

- Network Security Monitoring is focused on network anomalies like rogue hosts, encrypted traffic, suspicious service and port usage, and malicious/suspicious traffic patterns in an intrusion/anomaly detection and response approach.

- Monitoring and visualizing the network traffic and investigating suspicious events is a core part of Network Security Monitoring.

- This model is helpful for security analysts/incident responders, security engineers and threat hunters and covers identifying threats, vulnerabilities and security issues with a set of rules, signatures and patterns.

- Network Security Monitoring is part of the SOC, and the actions are separated between tier 1-2-3 analyst levels.

## Zeek vs Snort

- While both are called IDS/NIDS, it is good to know the cons and pros of each tool and use them in a specific manner.

- While there are some overlapping functionalities, they have different purposes for usage.

| Tool | Zeek | Snort |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Capabilities | NSM and IDS framework.<br>It is heavily focused on network analysis.<br>It is more focused on specific threats to trigger alerts.<br>The detection mechanism is focused on events. | An IDS/IPS system.<br>It is heavily focused on signatures to detect vulnerabilities.<br>The detection mechanism is focused on signature patterns and packets. |
| Cons | Hard to use.<br>The analysis is done out of the Zeek, manually or by automation. | Hard to detect complex threats. |
| Pros | It provides in-depth traffic visibility.<br>Useful for threat hunting.<br>Ability to detect complex threats.<br>It has a scripting language and supports event correlation.<br>Easy to read logs. | Easy to write rules.<br>Cisco supported rules.<br>Community support. |
| Common Use Case | Network monitoring.<br>In-depth traffic investigation.<br>Intrusion detecting in chained events. | Intrusion detection and prevention.<br>Stop known attacks/threats. |

## Zeek Architecture

- Zeek has two primary layers; "Event Engine" and "Policy Script Interpreter".

- The Event Engine layer is where the packets are processed; it is called the event core and is responsible for describing the event without focusing on event details.

- It is where the packets are divided into parts such as source and destination addresses, protocol identification, session analysis and file extraction.

- The Policy Script Interpreter layer is where the semantic analysis is conducted.

- It is responsible for describing the event correlations by using Zeek scripts.

![Zeek Architecture](/images/zeek-101.png)

## Zeek Frameworks

- Zeek has several frameworks to provide extended functionality in the scripting layer.

- These frameworks enhance Zeek's flexibility and compatibility with other network components.

- Each framework focuses on the specific use case and easily runs with Zeek installation.

- For instance, we will be using the "Logging Framework" for all cases. Having an idea of each framework's functionality can help users quickly identify an event of interest.

### Available Frameworks

| Logging | Notice | Input | Configuration | Intelligence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cluster | Broker Communication | Supervisor | GeoLocation | File Analysis |
| Signature | Summary | NetControl | Packet Analysis | TLS Decryption |

- You can read more on frameworks here.

## Zeek Outputs

- As mentioned before, Zeek provides 50+ log files under seven different categories, which are helpful in various areas such as traffic monitoring, intrusion detection, threat hunting and web analytics.

- This section is not intended to discuss the logs in-depth.

- Once you run Zeek, it will automatically start investigating the traffic or the given pcap file and generate logs automatically.

- Once you process a pcap with Zeek, it will create the logs in the working directory.

- If you run the Zeek as a service, your logs will be located in the default log path.

- The default log path is:/opt/zeek/logs/

## Working with Zeek

- There are two operation options for Zeek.

- The first one is running it as a service, and the second option is running the Zeek against a pcap.

- Before starting working with Zeek, let's check the version of the Zeek instance with the following command:

```bash
zeek -v
```

- Let's start the Zeek as a service!

- To do this, we need to use the "ZeekControl" module, as shown below.

- The "ZeekControl" module requires superuser permissions to use.

- You can elevate the session privileges and switch to the superuser account to examine the generated log files with the following command:

```bash
sudo su
```

- Here we can manage the Zeek service and view the status of the service.

- Primary management of the Zeek service is done with three commands; "status", "start", and "stop".

```bash
[ZeekControl] > status
Name Type Host Status Pid Started
zeek standalone localhost stopped
```

```bash
[ZeekControl] > start
starting zeek...
```

```bash
[ZeekControl] > status
Name Type Host Status Pid Started
zeek standalone localhost running 2541 13 Mar 18:25:08
```

```bash
[ZeekControl] > stop
stopping zeek...
```

```bash
[ZeekControl] > status
Name Type Host Status Pid Started
zeek standalone localhost stopped
```

- You can also use the "ZeekControl" mode with the following commands as well;

- zeekctl status

- zeekctl start

- zeekctl stop

- The only way to listen to the live network traffic is using Zeek as a service.

- Apart from using the Zeek as a network monitoring tool, we can also use it as a packet investigator.

- To do so, we need to process the pcap files with Zeek, as shown below.

- Once you process a pcap file, Zeek automatically creates log files according to the traffic.

- In pcap processing mode, logs are saved in the working directory.

- You can view the generated logs using the ls -l command.

```bash
zeek -C -r sample.pcap
```

```bash
ls -l
```

```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 11366 Mar 13 20:45 conn.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 763 Mar 13 20:45 dhcp.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 2918 Mar 13 20:45 dns.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 254 Mar 13 20:45 packet_filter.log
```

### Main Zeek command line parameters are explained below

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| -r | Reading option, read/process a pcap file. |
| -C | Ignoring checksum errors. |
| -v | Version information. |
| zeekctl | ZeekControl module. |

- Investigating the generated logs will require command-line tools (cat, cut, grep sort, and uniq) and additional tools (zeek-cut). We will cover them in the following tasks.

## Zeek Logs

- Zeek generates log files according to the traffic data.

- You will have logs for every connection in the wire, including the application level protocols and fields.

- Zeek is capable of identifying 50+ logs and categorizing them into seven categories.

- Zeek logs are well structured and tab-separated ASCII files, so reading and processing them is easy but requires effort.

- You should be familiar with networking and protocols to correlate the logs in an investigation, know where to focus, and find a specific piece of evidence.

- Each log output consists of multiple fields, and each field holds a different part of the traffic data.

- Correlation is done through a unique value called "UID". The "UID" represents the unique identifier assigned to each session.

### Zeek logs in a nutshell

| Category | Description | Log Files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Network | Network protocol logs. | conn.log, dce_rpc.log, dhcp.log, dnp3.log, dns.log, ftp.log, http.log, irc.log, kerberos.log, modbus.log, modbus_register_change.log, mysql.log, ntlm.log, ntp.log, radius.log, rdp.log, rfb.log, sip.log, smb_cmd.log, smb_files.log, smb_mapping.log, smtp.log, snmp.log, socks.log, ssh.log, ssl.log, syslog.log, tunnel.log. |
| Files | File analysis result logs. | files.log, ocsp.log, pe.log, x509.log. |
| NetControl | Network control and flow logs. | netcontrol.log, netcontrol_drop.log, netcontrol_shunt.log, netcontrol_catch_release.log, openflow.log. |
| Detection | Detection and possible indicator logs. | intel.log, notice.log, notice_alarm.log, signatures.log, traceroute.log. |
| Network Observations | Network flow logs. | known_certs.log, known_hosts.log, known_modbus.log, known_services.log, software.log. |
| Miscellaneous | Additional logs cover external alerts, inputs and failures. | barnyard2.log, dpd.log, unified2.log, unknown_protocols.log, weird.log, weird_stats.log. |
| Zeek Diagnostic | Zeek diagnostic logs cover system messages, actions and some statistics. | broker.log, capture_loss.log, cluster.log, config.log, loaded_scripts.log, packet_filter.log, print.log, prof.log, reporter.log, stats.log, stderr.log, stdout.log. |

- Please refer to Zeek's official documentation and Corelight log cheat sheet for more information.

- Although there are multiple log files, some log files are updated daily, and some are updated in each session.

- Some of the most commonly used logs are explained in the given table.

| Update Frequency | Log Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Daily | known_hosts.log | List of hosts that completed TCP handshakes. |
| Daily | known_services.log | List of services used by hosts. |
| Daily | known_certs.log | List of SSL certificates. |
| Daily | software.log | List of software used on the network. |
| Per Session | notice.log | Anomalies detected by Zeek. |
| Per Session | intel.log | Traffic contains malicious patterns/indicators. |
| Per Session | signatures.log | List of triggered signatures. |

- This is too much protocol and log information!

- Yes, it is true; a difficulty of working with Zeek is having the required network knowledge and investigation mindset.

- Don't worry; you can have both of these and even more knowledge by working through TryHackMe paths. Just keep the streak!

### Brief log usage primer table

| Overall Info | Protocol Based | Detection | Observation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| conn.log | http.log | notice.log | known_host.log |
| files.log | dns.log | signatures.log | known_services.log |
| intel.log | ftp.log | pe.log | software.log |
| loaded_scripts.log | ssh.log | traceroute.log | weird.log |

- You can categorise the logs before starting an investigation.

- Thus, finding the evidence/anomaly you are looking for will be easier.

- The given table is a brief example of using multiple log files.

- You can create your working model or customise the given one.

- Make sure you read each log description and understand the purpose to know what to expect from the corresponding log file.

- Note that these are not the only ones to focus on.

- Investigated logs are highly associated with the investigation case type and hypothesis, so do not just rely only on the logs given in the example table!

- The table shows us how to use multiple logs to identify anomalies and run an investigation by correlating across the available logs.

- Overall Info: The aim is to review the overall connections, shared files, loaded scripts and indicators at once. This is the first step of the investigation.

- Protocol Based: Once you review the overall traffic and find suspicious indicators or want to conduct a more in-depth investigation, you focus on a specific protocol.

- Detection: Use the prebuilt or custom scripts and signature outcomes to support your findings by having additional indicators or linked actions.

- Observation: The summary of the hosts, services, software, and unexpected activity statistics will help you discover possible missing points and conclude the investigation.

- Remember, we mention the pros and cons of the Zeek logs at the beginning of this task.

- Now let's demonstrate the log viewing and identify the differences between them.

- Recall 1: Zeek logs are well structured and tab-separated ASCII files, so reading and processing them is easy but requires effort.

- Recall 2: Investigating the generated logs will require command-line tools (cat, cut, grep sort, and uniq) and additional tools (zeek-cut).

### Opening a Zeek log with a text editor and built-in commands

![Opening a Zeek log with a text editor and built-in commands](/images/zeek-102.png)

- The above image shows that reading the logs with tools is not enough to spot an anomaly quickly.

- Logs provide a vast amount of data to investigate and correlate.

- You will need to have technical knowledge and event correlation ability to carry out an investigation.

- It is possible to use external visualisation and correlation tools such as ELK and Splunk.

- We will focus on using and processing the logs with a hands-on approach in this room.

- In addition to Linux command-line tools, one auxiliary program called zeek-cut reduces the effort of extracting specific columns from log files.

- Each log file provides "field names" in the beginning.

- This information will help you while using zeek-cut.

- Make sure that you use the "fields" and not the "types".

| Tool/Auxilary Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Zeek-cut | Cut specific columns from zeek logs. |

- Let's see the "zeek-cut" in action. Let's extract the uid, protocol, source and destination hosts, and source and destination ports from the conn.log.

- We will first read the logs with the cat command and then extract the event of interest fields with zeek-cut auxiliary to compare the difference.

```bash
cat conn.log
...
#fields ts uid id.orig_h id.orig_p id.resp_h id.resp_p proto service duration orig_bytes resp_bytes conn_state local_orig local_resp missed_bytes history orig_pkts orig_ip_bytes resp_pkts resp_ip_bytes tunnel_parents
#types time string addr port addr port enum string interval count count string bool bool count string count count count count set[string]
1488571051.943250 CTMFXm1AcIsSnq2Ric 192.168.121.2 51153 192.168.120.22 53 udp dns 0.001263 36 106 SF - -0 Dd 1 64 1 134 -
1488571038.380901 CLsSsA3HLB2N6uJwW 192.168.121.10 50080 192.168.120.10 514 udp - 0.000505 234 0 S0 - -0 D 2 290 0 0 -
```

```bash
cat conn.log | zeek-cut uid proto id.orig_h id.orig_p id.resp_h id.resp_p
CTMFXm1AcIsSnq2Ric udp 192.168.121.2 51153 192.168.120.22 53
CLsSsA3HLB2N6uJwW udp 192.168.121.10 50080 192.168.120.10 514
```

- As shown in the above output, the "zeek-cut" auxiliary provides massive help to extract specific fields with minimal effort.

- Now take time to read log formats, practice the log reading/extracting operations and answer the questions.

- Answer the questions below

- Each exercise has a folder. Ensure you are in the right directory to find the pcap file and accompanying files. Desktop/Exercise-Files/TASK-3

- Investigate the sample.pcap file. Investigate the dhcp.log file. What is the available hostname?

- Investigate the dns.log file. What is the number of unique DNS queries?

- Investigate the conn.log file. What is the longest connection duration?

## CLI Kung-Fu Recall: Processing Zeek Logs

- When processing massive amounts of data, GUIs are not stable and as effective as the CLI (Command Line Interface) tools.

- The critical point is: What if there is no "function/button/feature" for what you want to find/view/extract?

- Having the power to manipulate the data at the command line is a crucial skill for analysts.

- Not only in this room but each time you deal with packets, you will need to use command-line tools, Berkeley Packet Filters (BPF) and regular expressions to find/view/extract the data you are looking for.

- This task provides quick cheat-sheet like information to help you write CLI queries for your event of interest.

## Zeek Signatures

- Zeek supports signatures to have rules and event correlations to find noteworthy activities on the network.

- Zeek signatures use low-level pattern matching and cover conditions similar to Snort rules. Unlike Snort rules, Zeek rules are not the primary event detection point.

- Zeek has a scripting language and can chain multiple events to find an event of interest.

- Zeek signatures are composed of three logical paths; signature id, conditions and action.

- The signature breakdown is shown in the table below;

| Signature id | Unique signature name. |
| --- | --- |
| Conditions | Header: Filtering the packet headers for specific source and destination addresses, protocol and port numbers.<br>Content: Filtering the packet payload for specific value/pattern. |
| Action | Default action: Create the "signatures.log" file in case of a signature match.<br>Additional action: Trigger a Zeek script. |

- Now let's dig more into the Zeek signatures.

- The below table provides the most common conditions and filters for the Zeek signatures.

| Condition Field | Available Filters |
| --- | --- |
| Header | src-ip: Source IP.<br><br>dst-ip: Destination IP.<br><br>src-port: Source port.<br><br>dst-port: Destination port.<br><br>ip-proto: Target protocol. Supported protocols; TCP, UDP, ICMP, ICMP6, IP, IP6 |
| Content | payload: Packet payload.<br>http-request: Decoded HTTP requests.<br>http-request-header: Client-side HTTP headers.<br>http-request-body: Client-side HTTP request bodys.<br>http-reply-header: Server-side HTTP headers.<br>http-reply-body: Server-side HTTP request bodys.<br>ftp: Command line input of FTP sessions. |
| Context | same-ip: Filtering the source and destination addresses for duplication. |
| Action | event: Signature match message. |
| Comparison<br>Operators | ==, !=, <, <=, >, >= |
| NOTE! | Filters accept string, numeric and regex values. |

- Run Zeek with signature file::> zeek -C -r sample.pcap -s sample.sig

| Zeek signatures use the ".sig" extension. |
| --- |
| -C: Ignore checksum errors.<br> -r: Read pcap file.<br>-s: Use signature file. |

### Example | Cleartext Submission of Password

**Let's create a simple signature to detect HTTP cleartext passwords:**

- Sample Signature

```zeek
signature http-password {
ip-proto == tcp
dst-port == 80
payload /.*password.*/
event "Cleartext Password Found!"
}
```

- #signature: Signature name.

- # ip-proto: Filtering TCP connection.

- #dst-port: Filtering destination port 80.

- #payload: Filtering the "password" phrase.

- #event: Signature match message.

- Source: <https://tryhackme.com/room/zeekbro>

- Remember, Zeek signatures support regex.

- Regex ".*" matches any character zero or more times.

- The rule will match when a "password" phrase is detected in the packet payload.

- Once the match occurs, Zeek will generate an alert and create additional log files (signatures.log and notice.log).

- Signature Usage and Log Analysis

```bash
zeek -C -r http.pcap -s http-password.sig
```

```bash
ls
```

- clear-logs.sh conn.log files.log http-password.sig http.log http.pcap notice.log packet_filter.log signatures.log

```bash
cat notice.log | zeek-cut id.orig_h id.resp_h msg
10.10.57.178 44.228.249.3 10.10.57.178: Cleartext Password Found!
10.10.57.178 44.228.249.3 10.10.57.178: Cleartext Password Found!
```

```bash
cat signatures.log | zeek-cut src_addr dest_addr sig_id event_msg
10.10.57.178 http-password 10.10.57.178: Cleartext Password Found!
10.10.57.178 http-password 10.10.57.178: Cleartext Password Found!
```

- As shown in the above terminal output, the signatures.log and notice.log provide basic details and the signature message.

- Both of the logs also have the application banner field.

- So it is possible to know where the signature match occurs.

- Let's look at the application banner!

- Log Analysis

```bash
cat signatures.log | zeek-cut sub_msg
```

- POST /userinfo.php HTTP/1.1\x0d\x0aHost: testphp.vulnweb.com\x0d\x0aUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:98.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/…

```bash
cat notice.log | zeek-cut sub
POST /userinfo.php HTTP/1.1\x0d\x0aHost: testphp.vulnweb.com\x0d\x0aUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:98.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/…
```

- We will demonstrate only one log file output to avoid duplication after this point.

- You can practice discovering the event of interest by analysing notice.log and signatures.log.

### Example | FTP Brute-force

- Let's create another rule to filter FTP traffic.

- This time, we will use the FTP content filter to investigate command-line inputs of the FTP traffic.

- The aim is to detect FTP "admin" login attempts.

- This basic signature will help us identify the admin login attempts and have an idea of possible admin account abuse or compromise events.

- Sample ftp-admin Signature

```zeek
signature ftp-admin {
ip-proto == tcp
ftp /.*USER.*dmin.*/
event "FTP Admin Login Attempt!"
}
```

- Let's run the Zeek with the signature and investigate the signatures.log and notice.log.

- FTP Signature

```bash
zeek -C -r ftp.pcap -s ftp-admin.sig
```

```bash
cat signatures.log | zeek-cut src_addr dst_addr event_msg sub_msg | sort -r| uniq
```

- 10.234.125.254 10.121.70.151 10.234.125.254: FTP Admin Login Attempt! USER administrator
10.234.125.254 10.121.70.151 10.234.125.254: FTP Admin Login Attempt! USER admin

- Our rule shows us that there are multiple logging attempts with account names containing the "admin" phrase.

- The output gives us great information to notice if there is a brute-force attempt for an admin account.

- This signature can be considered a case signature.

- While it is accurate and works fine, we need global signatures to detect the "known threats/anomalies".

- We will need those case-based signatures for significant and sophisticated anomalies like zero-days and insider attacks in the real-life environment.

- Having individual rules for each case will create dozens of logs and alerts and cause missing the real anomaly.

- The critical point is logging logically, not logging everything.

- We can improve our signature by not limiting the focus only to an admin account.

- In that case, we need to know how the FTP protocol works and the default response codes.

- If you don't know these details, please refer to RFC documentation.

### Let's optimise our rule and make it detect all possible FTP brute-force attempts.

- This signature will create logs for each event containing "FTP 530 response", which allows us to track the login failure events regardless of username.

```zeek
signature ftp-brute {
ip-proto == tcp
payload /.*530.*Login.*incorrect.*/
event "FTP Brute-force Attempt"
}
```

- Source: <https://tryhackme.com/room/zeekbro>

- Zeek signature files can consist of multiple signatures. Therefore we can have one file for each protocol/situation/threat type. Let's demonstrate this feature in our global rule.

```zeek
signature ftp-username {
ip-proto == tcp
ftp /.*USER.*/
event "FTP Username Input Found!"
}
```

```zeek
signature ftp-brute {
ip-proto == tcp
payload /.*530.*Login.*incorrect.*/
event "FTP Brute-force Attempt!"
}
```

- Source: <https://tryhackme.com/room/zeekbro>

- Let's merge both of the signatures in a single file.

- We will have two different signatures, and they will generate alerts according to match status.

- The result will show us how we benefit from this action.

- Again, we will need the "CLI Kung-Fu" skills to extract the event of interest.

- This rule should show us two types of alerts and help us to correlate the events by having "FTP Username Input" and "FTP Brute-force Attempt" event messages.

- Let's investigate the logs. We're grepping the logs in range 1001-1004 to demonstrate that the first rule matches two different accounts (admin and administrator).

- FTP Signature

```bash
zeek -C -r ftp.pcap -s ftp-admin.sig
cat notice.log | zeek-cut uid id.orig_h id.resp_h msg sub | sort -r| nl | uniq | sed -n '1001,1004p'
```

- 1001 CeMYiaHA6AkfhSnd 10.234.125.254 10.121.70.151 10.234.125.254: FTP Username Input Found!

- USER admin
 1002 CeMYiaHA6AkfhSnd 10.234.125.254 10.121.70.151 10.121.70.151: FTP Brute-force Attempt!

- 530 Login incorrect.

- 1003 CeDTDZ2erDNF5w7dyf 10.234.125.254 10.121.70.151 10.234.125.254: FTP Username Input Found!

- USER administrator
 1004 CeDTDZ2erDNF5w7dyf 10.234.125.254 10.121.70.151 10.121.70.151: FTP Brute-force Attempt!

### Snort Rules in Zeek?

- While Zeek was known as Bro, it supported Snort rules with a script called snort2bro, which converted Snort rules to Bro signatures.

- However, after the rebranding, workflows between the two platforms have changed.

- The official Zeek document mentions that the script is no longer supported and is not a part of the Zeek distribution.

- Answer the questions below

- Each exercise has a folder. Ensure you are in the right directory to find the pcap file and accompanying files. Desktop/Exercise-Files/TASK-5

- Investigate the http.pcap file. Create the HTTP signature shown in the task and investigate the pcap. What is the source IP of the first event?

- What is the source port of the second event?

- Investigate the conn.log.

- What is the total number of the sent and received packets from source port 38706?

- Create the global rule shown in the task and investigate the ftp.pcap file.

- Investigate the notice.log. What is the number of unique events?

- What is the number of ftp-brute signature matches?

- Source: <https://tryhackme.com/room/zeekbro>

## Zeek Scripts

- Zeek has its own event-driven scripting language, which is as powerful as high-level languages and allows us to investigate and correlate the detected events.

- Since it is as capable as high-level programming languages, you will need to spend time on Zeek scripting language in order to become proficient.

- In this room, we will cover the basics of Zeek scripting to help you understand, modify and create basic scripts.

- Note that scripts can be used to apply a policy and in this case, they are called policy scripts.

| Zeek has base scripts installed by default, and these are not intended to be modified. | These scripts are located in<br> "/opt/zeek/share/zeek/base". |
| --- | --- |
| User-generated or modified scripts should be located in a specific path. | These scripts are located in<br>"/opt/zeek/share/zeek/site". |
| Policy scripts are located in a specific path. | These scripts are located in<br> "/opt/zeek/share/zeek/policy". |
| Like Snort, to automatically load/use a script in live sniffing mode, you must identify the script in the Zeek configuration file. You can also use a script for a single run, just like the signatures. | The configuration file is located in<br> "/opt/zeek/share/zeek/site/local.ze<br>ek". |

- Zeek scripts use the ".zeek" extension.

- Do not modify anything under the "zeek/base" directory. User-generated and modified scripts should be in the "zeek/site" directory.

- You can call scripts in live monitoring mode by loading them with the command load @/script/path or load @script-name in local.zeek file.

- Zeek is event-oriented, not packet-oriented! We need to use/write scripts to handle the event of interest.

- running Zeek with signature

```bash
zeek -C -r sample.pcap -s sample.sig
```

### GUI vs Scripts

- Have you ever thought about automating tasks in Wireshark, tshark or tcpdump?

- Zeek provides that chance to us with its scripting power.

- Let's say we need to extract all available DHCP hostnames from a pcap file.

- In that case, we have several options like using tcpdump, Wireshark, tshark or Zeek.

![GUI vs Scripts](/images/zeek-103.png)

- Let's see Wireshark on the stage first.

- You can have the same information with Wireshark.

- However, while this information can be extracted using Wireshark is not easy to transfer the data to another tool for processing.

- Tcpdump and tshark are command-line tools, and it is easy to extract and transfer the data to another tool for processing and correlating.

**extracting hostnames with tcpdump and tshark:**

```bash
sudo tcpdump -ntr smallFlows.pcap port 67 or port 68 -e -vv | grep 'Hostname Option' | awk -F: '{print $2}' | sort -nr | uniq | nl
```

- 1 "vinlap01"
 2 "student01-PC"

```bash
tshark -V -r smallFlows.pcap -Y "udp.port==67 or udp.port==68" -T fields -e dhcp.option.hostname | nl | awk NF
```

- 1 student01-PC
 2 vinlap01

- Now let's see Zeek scripts in action.

- First, let's look at the components of the Zeek script.

- Here the first, second and fourth lines are the predefined syntaxes of the scripting language.

- The only part we created is the third line which tells Zeek to extract DHCP hostnames.

- Now compare this automation ease with the rest of the methods.

- Obviously, this four-line script is easier to create and use.

- While tcpdump and tshark can provide similar results, transferring uncontrolled data through multiple pipelines is not much preferred.

```zeek
event dhcp_message (c: connection, is_orig: bool, msg: DHCP::Msg, options: DHCP::Options)
{
print options$host_name;
}
```

- Now let's use the Zeek script and see the output.

- extracting hostnames with tcpdump and tshark

```bash
zeek -C -r smallFlows.pcap dhcp-hostname.zeek
```

- student01-PC
vinlap01

- The provided outputs show that our script works fine and can extract the requested information.

- This should show why Zeek is helpful in data extraction and correlation.

- Note that Zeek scripting is a programming language itself, and we are not covering the fundamentals of Zeek scripting.

- In this room, we will cover the logic of Zeek scripting and how to use Zeek scripts.

- You can learn and practice the Zeek scripting language by using Zeek's official training platform for free.

- There are multiple options to trigger conditions in Zeek.

- Zeek can use "Built-In Function" (Bif) and protocols to extract information from traffic data.

- You can find supported protocols and Bif either by looking in your setup or visiting the Zeek repo.

| Customized script locations |
| --- |
| /opt/zeek/share/zeek/base/bif<br>/opt/zeek/share/zeek/base/bif/plugins<br>/opt/zeek/share/zeek/base/protocols |

- Answer the questions below

- Each exercise has a folder. Ensure you are in the right directory to find the pcap file and accompanying files. Desktop/Exercise-Files/TASK-6

- Investigate the smallFlows.pcap file. Investigate the dhcp.log file. What is the domain value of the "vinlap01" host?

- Investigate the bigFlows.pcap file. Investigate the dhcp.log file. What is the number of identified unique hostnames?

- Investigate the dhcp.log file. What is the identified domain value?

## Zeek Scripts | Scripts and Signatures

- Source: <https://tryhackme.com/room/zeekbro>

### Scripts 101 | Write Basic Scripts

- Scripts contain operators, types, attributes, declarations and statements, and directives.

- Let's look at a simple example event called "zeek_init" and "zeek_done".

- These events work once the Zeek process starts and stops.

- Note that these events don't have parameters, and some events will require parameters.

**Sample Script:**

```zeek
event zeek_init()
{
print ("Started Zeek!");
}
event zeek_done()
{
print ("Stopped Zeek!");
}
```

- # zeek_init: Do actions once Zeek starts its process.

- # zeek_done: Do activities once Zeek finishes its process.

- #print: Prompt a message on the terminal.

- Run Zeek with a script

```bash
zeek -C -r sample.pcap 101.zeek
Started Zeek!
Stopped Zeek!
```

- The above output shows how the script works and provides messages on the terminal.

- Zeek will create logs in the working directory separately from the scripts tasks.

- Let's print the packet data to the terminal and see the raw data.

- In this script, we are requesting details of a connection and extracting them without any filtering or sorting of the data.

- To accomplish this, we are using the "new_connection" event.

- This event is automatically generated for each new connection.

- This script provides bulk information on the terminal.

- We need to get familiar with Zeek's data structure to reduce the amount of information and focus on the event of interest.

- To do so, we need to investigate the bulk data.

**Sample Script:**

```zeek
event new_connection(c: connection)
{
print c;
}
```

**Run Zeek with a script:**

```bash
zeek -C -r sample.pcap 102.zeek
```

- [id=[orig_h=192.168.121.40, orig_p=123/udp, resp_h=212.227.54.68, resp_p=123/udp], orig=[size=48, state=1, num_pkts=0, num_bytes_ip=0, flow_label=0, l2_addr=00:16:47:df:e7:c1], resp=[size=0, state=0, num_pkts=0, num_bytes_ip=0, flow_label=0, l2_addr=00:00:0c:9f:f0:79], start_time=1488571365.706238, duration=0 secs, service={}, history=D, uid=CajwDY2vSUtLkztAc, tunnel=, vlan=121, inner_vlan=, dpd=, dpd_state=, removal_hooks=, conn=, extract_orig=F, extract_resp=F, thresholds=, dce_rpc=, dce_rpc_state=, dce_rpc_backing=, dhcp=, dnp3=, dns=, dns_state=, ftp=, ftp_data_reuse=F, ssl=, http=, http_state=, irc=, krb=, modbus=, mysql=, ntlm=, ntp=, radius=, rdp=, rfb=, sip=, sip_state=, snmp=, smb_state=, smtp=, smtp_state=, socks=, ssh=, syslog=]

- The above terminal provides bulk data for each connection.

- This style is not the best usage, and in real life, we will need to filter the information for specific purposes.

- If you look closely at the output, you can see an ID and field value for each part.

- To filter the event of interest, we will use the primary tag (in this case, it is c --comes from "c: connection"--), id value (id=), and field name.

- You should notice that the fields are the same as the fields in the log files.

- Sample Script

```zeek
event new_connection(c: connection)
{
print ("###########################################################");
print ("");
print ("New Connection Found!");
print ("");
print fmt ("Source Host: %s # %s --->", c$id$orig_h, c$id$orig_p);
print fmt ("Destination Host: resp: %s # %s <---", c$id$resp_h, c$id$resp_p);
print ("");
}
```

- #%s: Identifies string output for the source.#c$id: Source reference field for the identifier.

- Now you have a general idea of running a script and following the provided output on the console.

- Let's look closer to another script that extracts specific information from packets.

- The script above creates logs and prompts each source and destination address for each connection.

- Let's see this script in action.

- Run Zeek with a script

```bash
zeek -C -r sample.pcap 103.zeek
```

```bash
###########################################################
```

- New Connection Found! Source Host: 192.168.121.2 # 58304/udp --->
Destination Host: resp: 192.168.120.22 # 53/udp <---
###########################################################

- The above output shows that we successfully extract specific information from the events.

- Remember that this script extracts the event of interest (in this example, a new connection), and we still have logs in the working directory.

- We can always modify and optimise the scripts at any time.

### Scripts 201 | Use Scripts and Signatures Together

- Up to here, we covered the basics of Zeek scripts.

- Now it is time to use scripts collaboratively with other scripts and signatures to get one step closer to event correlation.

- Zeek scripts can refer to signatures and other Zeek scripts as well.

- This flexibility provides a massive advantage in event correlation.

- Let's demonstrate this concept with an example.

- We will create a script that detects if our previously created "ftp-admin" rule has a hit.

```zeek
event signature_match (state: signature_state, msg: string, data: string)
{
if (state$sig_id == "ftp-admin")
{
print ("Signature hit! --> #FTP-Admin ");
}
}
```

- Source: <https://tryhackme.com/room/zeekbro>

- This basic script quickly checks if there is a signature hit and provides terminal output to notify us.

- We are using the "signature_match" event to accomplish this.

- You can read more about events here.

- Note that we are looking only for "ftp-admin" signature hits.

- The signature is shown below.

- Sample Script

```zeek
signature ftp-admin {
ip-proto == tcp
ftp /.*USER.*admin.*/
event "FTP Username Input Found!"
}
```

- Source: <https://tryhackme.com/room/zeekbro>

#### Let's see this script in action.

- Run Zeek with signature and script

```bash
zeek -C -r ftp.pcap -s ftp-admin.sig 201.zeek
```

- Signature hit! --> #FTP-Admin Signature hit! --> #FTP-Admin
Signature hit! --> #FTP-Admin Signature hit! --> #FTP-Admin

- The above output shows that we successfully combined the signature and script.

- Zeek processed the signature and logs then the script controlled the outputs and provided a terminal output for each rule hit.

### Scripts 202 | Load Local Scripts

#### Load all local scripts

- We mentioned that Zeek has base scripts located in "/opt/zeek/share/zeek/base".

- You can load all local scripts identified in your "local.zeek" file.

- Note that base scripts cover multiple framework functionalities.

- You can load all base scripts by easily running the local command.

- Load local scripts

```bash
zeek -C -r ftp.pcap local
```

```bash
ls
```

```bash
101.zeek 103.zeek clear-logs.sh ftp.pcap packet_filter.log stats.log
102.zeek capture_loss.log conn.log loaded_scripts.log sample.pcap weird.log
```

- The above output demonstrates how to run all base scripts using the "local" command.

- Look at the above terminal output;

- Zeek provided additional log files this time.

- Loaded scripts generated loaded_scripts.log, capture_loss.log, notice.log, stats.log files.

- Note that, in our instance, 465 scripts loaded and used by using the "local" command.

- However, Zeek doesn't provide log files for the scripts doesn't have hits or results.

#### Load Specific Scripts

- Another way to load scripts is by identifying the script path.

- In that case, you have the opportunity of loading a specific script or framework.

- Let's go back to FTP brute-forcing case.

- We created a script that detects multiple admin login failures in previous steps.

- Zeek has an FTP brute-force detection script as well.

- Now let's use the default script and identify the differences.

- Load local scripts

```bash
zeek -C -r ftp.pcap /opt/zeek/share/zeek/policy/protocols/ftp/detect-bruteforcing.zeek
```

```bash
cat notice.log | zeek-cut ts note msg
```

- 1024380732.223481 FTP::Bruteforcing 10.234.125.254 had 20 failed logins on 1 FTP server in 0m1s

- The above output shows how to load a specific script.

- This script provides much more information than the one we created.

- It provides one single line output and a connection summary for the suspicious incident.

- You can find and read more on the prebuilt scripts and frameworks by visiting Zeek's online book here.

- Answer the questions below

- Go to folder TASK-7/101.

- Investigate the sample.pcap file with 103.zeek script. Investigate the terminal output. What is the number of the detected new connections?

```bash
zeek -C -r sample.pcap 103.zeek
```

```bash
cat conn.log | zeek-cut uid | wc -l
```

- Go to folder TASK-7/201.

- Investigate the ftp.pcap file with ftp-admin.sig signature and 201.zeek script. Investigate the signatures.log file. What is the number of signature hits?

```bash
zeek -C -r ftp.pcap -s ftp-admin.sig
```

```bash
cat signatures.log | zeek-cut uid | wc -l
```

- Investigate the signatures.log file. What is the total number of "administrator" username detections?

```bash
cat signatures.log | grep -i administrator | wc -l
```

- Investigate the ftp.pcap file with all local scripts, and investigate the loaded_scripts.log file. What is the total number of loaded scripts?

```bash
zeek -C -r ftp.pcap local
```

- Go to folder TASK-7/202.

- Investigate the ftp-brute.pcap file with "/opt/zeek/share/zeek/policy/protocols/ftp/detect-bruteforcing.zeek" script.

- Investigate the notice.log file.

- What is the total number of brute-force detections?

- Source: <https://tryhackme.com/room/zeekbro>

## Zeek Scripts | Frameworks

![Zeek Scripts | Frameworks](/images/zeek-104.png)

### Scripts 203 | Load Frameworks

- Zeek has 15+ frameworks that help analysts to discover the different events of interest.

- In this task, we will cover the common frameworks and functions.

- You can find and read more on the prebuilt scripts and frameworks by visiting Zeek's online book here.

#### File Framework | Hashes

- Not all framework functionalities are intended to be used in CLI mode.

- The majority of them are used in scripting.

- You can easily see the usage of frameworks in scripts by calling a specific framework as

- load @ $PATH/base/frameworks/framework-name.

- Now, let's use a prebuilt function of the file framework and have MD5, SHA1 and SHA256 hashes of the detected files.

- We will call the "File Analysis" framework's "hash-all-files" script to accomplish this.

- Before loading the scripts, let's look at how it works.

- View file framework

```bash
cat hash-demo.zeek
```

- # Enable MD5, SHA1 and SHA256 hashing for all files.

```zeek
@load /opt/zeek/share/zeek/policy/frameworks/files/hash-all-files.zeek
```

- The above output shows how frameworks are loaded.

- In earlier tasks, we mentioned that Zeek highly relies on scripts, and the frameworks depend on scripts.

- Let's have a closer look at the file hash framework and see the script behind it.

- View file framework

```bash
cat /opt/zeek/share/zeek/policy/frameworks/files/hash-all-files.zeek
```

- #Enable MD5, SHA1 and SHA256 hashing for all files.

```zeek
@load base/files/hash
event file_new(f: fa_file)
{
Files::add_analyzer(f, Files::ANALYZER_MD5);
Files::add_analyzer(f, Files::ANALYZER_SHA1);
Files::add_analyzer(f, Files::ANALYZER_SHA256);
}
```

- Now let's execute the script and investigate the log file.

- Grab file hashes

```bash
zeek -C -r case1.pcap hash-demo.zeek
```

```bash
zeek -C -r case1.pcap /opt/zeek/share/zeek/policy/frameworks/files/hash-all-files.zeek
```

```bash
cat files.log | zeek-cut md5 sha1 sha256
```

- cd5a4d3fdd5bffc16bf959ef75cf37bc 33bf88d5b82df3723d5863c7d23445e345828904 6137f8db2192e638e13610f75e73b9247c05f4706f0afd1fdb132d86de6b4012

- Look at the above terminal outputs.

- Both of the scripts provided the same result.

- Here the preference is up to the user.

- Both of the usage formats are true.

- Prebuilt frameworks are commonly used in scriptings with the "@load" method.

- Specific scripts are used as practical scripts for particular use cases.

#### File Framework | Extract Files

- The file framework can extract the files transferred.

- Let's see this feature in action!

- Extract files

```bash
zeek -C -r case1.pcap /opt/zeek/share/zeek/policy/frameworks/files/extract-all-files.zeek
```

```bash
ls
```

- 101.zeek 102.zeek 103.zeek case1.pcap clear-logs.sh conn.log dhcp.log dns.log extract_files files.log ftp.pcap http.log packet_filter.log pe.log

- We successfully extracted files from the pcap.

- A new folder called "extract_files" is automatically created, and all detected files are located in it.

- First, we will list the contents of the folder, and then we will use the file command to determine the file type of the extracted files.

- Investigate files

```bash
ls extract_files | nl
1 extract-1561667874.743959-HTTP-Fpgan59p6uvNzLFja
2 extract-1561667889.703239-HTTP-FB5o2Hcauv7vpQ8y3
3 extract-1561667899.060086-HTTP-FOghls3WpIjKpvXaEl
```

```bash
cd extract_files
```

```bash

 3 extract-1561667899.060086-HTTP-FOghls3WpIjKpvXaEl: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows

- Zeek extracted three files.

- The "file" command shows us one.txt file, one.doc/.docx file and one.exe file.

- Zeek renames extracted files.

- The name format consists of four values that come from conn.log and files.log files; default "extract" keyword, timestamp value (ts), protocol (source), and connection id (conn_uids).

- Let's look at the files.log to understand possible anomalies better and verify the findings.

- Look at the below output; files.log provides the same results with additional details.

- Let's focus on the.exe and correlate this finding by searching its connection id (conn_uids).

- The given terminal output shows us that there are three files extracted from the traffic capture.

- Let's look at the file.log and correlate the findings with the rest of the log files.

- Investigate files

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat files.log | zeek-cut fuid conn_uids tx_hosts rx_hosts mime_type extracted | nl

```

- The "grep" tool helps us investigate the particular value across all available logs.

- The above terminal output shows us that the connection id linked with.exe appears in conn.log, files.log, and http.log files.

- Given example demonstrates how to filter some fields and correlate the findings with the rest of the logs.

- We've listed the source and destination addresses, file and connection id numbers, MIME types, and file names.

- Up to now, provided outputs and findings show us that record number three is a.exe file, and other log files provide additional information.

#### Notice Framework | Intelligence

- The intelligence framework can work with data feeds to process and correlate events and identify anomalies.

- The intelligence framework requires a feed to match and create alerts from the network traffic.

- Let's demonstrate a single user-generated threat intel file and let Zeek use it as the primary intelligence source.

- Intelligence source location: /opt/zeek/intel/zeek_intel.txt

- There are two critical points you should never forget.

- First, the source file has to be tab-delimited.

- Second, you can manually update the source and adding extra lines doesn't require any re-deployment.

- However, if you delete a line from the file, you will need to re-deploy the Zeek instance.

- Let's add the suspicious URL gathered from the case1.pcap file as a source intel and see this feature in action!

- Before executing the script, let's look at the intelligence file and the script contents.

- Investigate intel file and script

```bash
cat /opt/zeek/intel/zeek_intel.txt
```

```bash
#fields indicator indicator_type meta.source meta.desc
```

- smart-fax.com Intel::DOMAIN zeek-intel-test Zeek-Intelligence-Framework-Test

```bash
cat intelligence-demo.zeek
#Load intelligence framework!
```

```zeek
@load policy/frameworks/intel/seen
@load policy/frameworks/intel/do_notice
redef Intel::read_files += { "/opt/zeek/intel/zeek_intel.txt" };
```

- The above output shows the contents of the intel file and script contents.

- There is one intelligence input, and it is focused on a domain name, so when this domain name appears in the network traffic, Zeek will create the "intel.log" file and provide the available details.

- Investigate intel file and script

```bash
zeek -C -r case1.pcap intelligence-demo.zeek
```

```bash
cat intel.log | zeek-cut uid id.orig_h id.resp_h seen.indicator matched
CZ1jLe2nHENdGQX377 10.6.27.102 10.6.27.1 smart-fax.com Intel::DOMAIN
C044Ot1OxBt8qCk7f2 10.6.27.102 107.180.50.162 smart-fax.com Intel::DOMAIN
```

- The above output shows that Zeek detected the listed domain and created the intel.log file.

- This is one of the easiest ways of using the intelligence framework.

- You can read more on the intelligence framework here and here.

- Answer the questions below

- Each exercise has a folder. Ensure you are in the right directory to find the pcap file and accompanying files. Desktop/Exercise-Files/TASK-8

## Zeek Scripts | Packages

![Zeek Scripts | Packages](/images/zeek-105.png)

### Scripts 204 | Package Manager

- Zeek Package Manager helps users install third-party scripts and plugins to extend Zeek functionalities with ease.

- The package manager is installed with Zeek and available with the zkg command.

- Users can install, load, remove, update and create packages with the "zkg" tool.

- You can read more on and view available packages here and here.

- Please note that you need root privileges to use the "zkg" tool.

#### Basic usage of zkg

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| zkg install package_path | Install a package. Example (zkg install zeek/j-gras/zeek-af_packet-plugin). |
| zkg install git_url | Install package. Example (zkg install https://github.com/corelight/ztest). |
| zkg list | List installed package. |
| zkg remove | Remove installed package. |
| zkg refresh | Check version updates for installed packages. |
| zkg upgrade | Update installed packages. |

- There are multiple ways of using packages.

- The first approach is using them as frameworks and calling specific package path/directory per usage.

- The second and most common approach is calling packages from a script with the "@load" method.

- The third and final approach to using packages is calling their package names; note that this method works only for packages installed with the "zkg" install method.

#### Packages | Cleartext Submission of Password

- Let's install a package first and then demonstrate the usage in different approaches.

- Note: The package is installed in the given VM.

- Install package with zkg

```bash
zkg install zeek/cybera/zeek-sniffpass
```

- The following packages will be INSTALLED:
 zeek/cybera/zeek-sniffpass (master)
Proceed? [Y/n] Y
Installing "zeek/cybera/zeek-sniffpass"
Installed "zeek/cybera/zeek-sniffpass" (master)
Loaded "zeek/cybera/zeek-sniffpass"

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ zkg list
zeek/cybera/zeek-sniffpass (installed: master) - Sniffpass will alert on cleartext passwords discovered in HTTP POST requests
```

- The above output shows how to install and list the installed packages.

- Now we successfully installed a package.

- As the description mentions on the above terminal, this package creates alerts for cleartext passwords found in HTTP traffic.

- Let's use this package in three different ways!

- Execute/load package

```bash
###Calling with script
```

```bash
zeek -Cr http.pcap sniff-demo.zeek
```

```bash
###View script contents
```

```bash
cat sniff-demo.zeek
@load /opt/zeek/share/zeek/site/zeek-sniffpass
```

```bash
###Calling from path
```

```bash
zeek -Cr http.pcap /opt/zeek/share/zeek/site/zeek-sniffpass
```

```bash
###Calling with package name
```

```bash
zeek -Cr http.pcap zeek-sniffpass
```

- The above output demonstrates how to execute/load packages against a pcap.

- You can use the best one for your case.

- The "zeek-sniffpass" package provides additional information in the notice.log file.

- Now let's review the logs and discover the obtained data using the specific package.

- Investigate log files

```bash
cat notice.log | zeek-cut id.orig_h id.resp_h proto note msg
```

- 10.10.57.178 44.228.249.3 tcp SNIFFPASS::HTTP_POST_Password_Seen Password found for user BroZeek
10.10.57.178 44.228.249.3 tcp SNIFFPASS::HTTP_POST_Password_Seen Password found for user ZeekBro

- The above output shows that the package found cleartext password submissions, provided notice, and grabbed the usernames.

- Remember, in TASK-5 we created a signature to do the same action.

- Now we can do the same activity without using a signature file. This is a simple demonstration of the benefit and flexibility of the Zeek scripts.

#### Packages | Geolocation Data

- Let's use another helpful package called "geoip-conn".

- This package provides geolocation information for the IP addresses in the conn.log file.

- It depends on "GeoLite2-City.mmdb" database created by MaxMind.

- This package provides location information for only matched IP addresses from the internal database.

- Execute/load package

```bash
zeek -Cr case1.pcap geoip-conn
```

```bash
cat conn.log | zeek-cut uid id.orig_h id.resp_h geo.orig.country_code geo.orig.region geo.orig.city geo.orig.latitude geo.orig.longitude geo.resp.country_code geo.resp.region geo.resp.city
```

- Up to now, we've covered what the Zeek packages are and how to use them.

- There are much more packages and scripts available for Zeek in the wild.

- You can try ready or third party packages and scripts or learn Zeek scripting language and create new ones.

- Answer the questions below

- Each exercise has a folder. Ensure you are in the right directory to find the pcap file and accompanying files. Desktop/Exercise-Files/TASK-9
